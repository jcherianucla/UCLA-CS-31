# UCLA-CS-31
These are my solutions for the seven projects from UCLA CS 31 Fall 2014 with Prof Smallberg. These are my own solutions and are therefore not perfect. The source code for the various projects should only be used as a vague guideline to help you if you are stuck. Do not copy directly from these files as they will result in your own penalisation!
